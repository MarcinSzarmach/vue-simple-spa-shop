# Vue Shop very very (very) simple app ;)

To run app You need Node.js and npm.

Running:

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## REST API mock

In ./src/mock contains all webservices.

Every request to mocker has a delay setted to 1000ms (last line in ./src/mocks/index.js), this is special action, to show loader.

Unfortunately project won't work without mocker-api :( It is SPA app :)
